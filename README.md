# Frontend for Ducky Exchange

## Challenge

Use Case:
Donald wants to give each of his three kids, Huey, Luey, and Duey, birthday presents. He intends to give each of his children 5 Bitcoin each. The problem is that each of his kids has requested different coin currencies. Huey wants Ethereum. Luey is all about Litecoin. Duey is gloating about being into DASH. Donald wants to get the best rates possible when he converts the coins to give his children and wants a tool to calculate that for him. 

Because Donald doesn't believe in alt coins and will live and die by Bitcoin, he also wants to set up a savings account of Bitcoin for each of his children to get when they are of age. The problem is that none of his kids have Bitcoin accounts and are confused by wallets. 

Base Challenge:
Write a web app using Node JS as the backend and React JS as the client portal that will find out what the best exchanges would be for each of these trades. The app should talk to the Kraken, BTC-E, Poloniex, and CoinCap APIâ€™s to get real data. 

Track 1 (Back end focus):
Store the pricing data inside a database of your choice (Ideas by Nature uses PostgreSQL) for querying data, showing trends, and displaying charts. 

Install and configure bitcoind to create 3 Bitcoin addresses to send funds into. Bonus points for integrating Ethereum contracts in some way.
